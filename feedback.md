# Giving feedback

The goal of this guide is to define a basic methodology to follow when giving feedback. The final goal is to provide to the engineer some constructive feedback which includes:

* Reinforce positivie feedback you have for them
* Provide a set of suggestions for improvement, that will cover the negative feedback

When giving feedback that we want it should have some effect, we need to cover six steps:

1. Pre-planning the feedback session
2. Set the scenario and explain any issues
3. Make sure we are having a two-way conversation / Practive active listening
4. Determine a plan of action
5. Get a commitment
6. Follow up on the commitment

## 1. Pre-planning

* When planning and preparing the feedback is going to be delivered (ours or from a third party) we need to make sure we are separing the **fact** from the **opinion**.
* We might want to present the situations with a *What if* structure.
* We should provide feedback on behaviours that are **changeable**, otherwise it is just noise that might prevent focusing on actionable feedback.
* We need to decide the right moment to give feedback, to maximize the impact.
* Let's always prepare an overview of the feedback situation
