# Giving feedback

The goal of this guide is to define a basic methodology to follow when giving feedback. The final goal is to provide to the employee some constructive feedback which includes:

* Reinforce positivie feedback you have for them
* Provide a set of suggestions for improvement, that will cover the negative feedback

When giving feedback that we want it should have some effect, we need to cover six steps:

1. Pre-planning the feedback session
2. Set the scenario and explain any issues
3. Make sure we are having a two-way conversation / Practive active listening
4. Determine a plan of action
5. Get a commitment
6. Follow up on the commitment

## 1. Pre-planning

* When planning and preparing the feedback is going to be delivered (ours or from a third party) we need to make sure we are separing the **fact** from the **opinion**.
* You have to be prepared. Try creating situations by using the *What if...* approach.
* We should provide feedback on behaviours that are **changeable**, otherwise it is just noise that might prevent focusing on actionable feedback.
* We need to decide the right moment to give feedback, to maximize the impact.
* Let's always prepare an overview of the feedback situation

## 2. Set the scene

* The feedback will always take place in private.
* Look for a comfortable place and set a time.
* The idea is to have an informal meeting, so that it can be a much productive from both parts as possible.
* Start with the positive.
* Then it is time to explain the issues / things to improve. Be specific, be objetctive. Again, facts VS opinion.
* The idea is to balance the two previous points. Limit the feedback to avoid overwhelming the employee.

## 3. The two-way conversation

* Control your feelings, be prepared and cool (What if...)
* When expressing your opinion use the **I** to point you as the center of the action instead of the **You** approach, which might be interpreted as a blaming against the other person.
* Focus on the consequences of the behavior you want to change
* Do not rush, spend the required time on this conversation and get as much feedback as possible
* Extra trips:
    * Focus on behavior, not personality
    * Avoid words like adverbs (never, always, etc.)
    * Ask questions to prompt self-reflection

## 4. Determine a plan of action

* Suggest solutions and give choices, but let the other person take the decision. Those choices should have a clear definition and impact.
* Collaborate with the plan, working together.
* Ask questions:
    * What do you suggest?
    * Which one is the best approach?
* Select actions compatible with the persons **goals**. These actions should be seen as a benefit for that person.
* Provide training and tools
* Confirm that all is properly understood
* Set a timeline and a deadline and, if possible, a follow-up for the actions agreed.

## 5-6. Commitment and follow-up
There are no specific comments on these topics.

## Communication strategies

* Let go minor disagreement and do not try to always be right.
* Give options: understand other's perspective and try to find common ground.
* Avoid angry comments for feedback.
* Do not rush: Clarify and give space for expression. Give time to make sure the communication is clear and has been understood.

### Techniques

* Use I statements, as explained before.
* XYZ technique: When - What - How. Can be useful for reinforcement on positive feedback and for negative feedback.
* Feel-good sandwich. Provide some negative feedback between two positive statements.

### Efective listening

* Start by stop talking :-)
* Maintain eye contact.
* Avoid the problem-solving approach.
* Mirror, express again the shared idea with your own words. Validate that what you have listened makes sense.
* Finally, share thoughts and opinions

### How to deliver feedback

* Be congruent: body language, vocal tone and verbal expressions.
* Non verbal message **is important**. Relax and smile, keep eye contact and try to express positivements via your body.
* About the voice: Avoid hesitation, speak with confidence and slowly, that way you will give space and time to think to the employee.
